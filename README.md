# LearningJava-Console
>Description

This is my personal journey learning Java from a C++/C# background. I am learning through trial and error, googling each syntax error I encounter. The projects I'm using are create through IntelliJ IDEA. 

>Purpose

I need to learning Java/Kotlin for Android Dev in order to qualify for jobs. This repository, along with LearningKotlin-Console and LearningAndroid-App will be tied together as the same journey. Java is my my first step.
